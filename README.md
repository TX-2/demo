This repository exists for the web-based simulator to be deployed into
it, so that it can be served from GitHub pages.

The code for the web-based simulator itself is in
https://github.com/TX-2/TX-2-simulator.  That repository also contains
the GitHub actions which deploy code into this repository.

If you want to see the files as deployed to make the demo run, look at
the gh-pages branch of this repository.
